# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting is interested in making a new cryptocurrency available to its customers. A report needs to be made with the cryptocurrencies that are available on the market.  These cryptocurrencies should be grouped together using a clustering method.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to analyze the data. 3 prinicipal components are created and a K-means of 4 is used. With this a plot is able to be created plotting the number of coins mined vs the total coins supplied.  Majority of the coins are clustered toghether, except for BitTorrent which has the most coins mined and a high total supply of coins and Turtlecoin which has a high number of coins supplied but low amount of coins mined. It would be recommended for Accountability Accounting to offer their clients the BitTorrent coin.
